%PROBLEM232_EULER002 Project Euler: Problem 2, Sum of even Fibonacci
%
% Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous
% two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be:
%
%     1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...
%
% By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not
% exceed the input value, find the sum of the even-valued terms.
fibminus2 = 0;
fibminus1 = 1;
fib = 0;
y = 0;
while fib <= x
  if ~mod(fib, 2)
    y = y + fib;
  end
  fib = fibminus2 + fibminus1;
  fibminus2 = fibminus1;
